- 👋 Hi, I’m @zermpinos, a integrated master mechanical engineer with a focus on energy engineering.
- 👀 I’m interested in automations and zero - energy buildings as far as programming is involved but I am also very interested in Photovoltaic/Thermal Panels and Solar Assisted Heat Pumps.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to analyze and visualize data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much any project that will help me learn something new and grow.
